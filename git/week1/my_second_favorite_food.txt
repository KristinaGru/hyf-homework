Ingredients
Muffins:

1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

¾ cup white sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon salt

⅓ cup vegetable oil

1 egg

⅓ cup milk, or more as needed

1 cup fresh blueberries

Crumb Topping:

½ cup white sugar

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

¼ cup butter, cubed

1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.

For the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.

Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter aside.

For the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.

Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
